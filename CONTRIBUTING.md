# Contributing to AEON Context Kernel

Thank you for helping improve the project. Contributions must preserve the project’s trust, pre-effect enforcement, and deterministic replay boundaries.

## Current development gate

The repository is currently frozen at **S0 (`0.2.x`)** while an independent security review is pending. Until that review passes, contributions should be limited to S0 security fixes, tests, documentation corrections, CI/reproducibility improvements, and audit support. Do not begin S1, provider integration, AEON-IQ integration, or real-effect adapters on `main`.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adaptive-Liquidity/aeon-context-kernel.git
cd aeon-context-kernel
uv sync --extra dev --locked
uv run pytest
```

Create a focused branch, keep changes narrow, and include tests for observable behavior. Never infer authority, approval, test success, or provenance from prose.

## Required local checks

Run the following before opening a pull request:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check src tests examples
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest
uv run ckernel bench smoke --results-root .ci-results
```

Generated benchmark artifacts belong in local result directories or a versioned release-evidence package, not in ordinary source commits.

## Pull-request expectations

A pull request must explain the intended behavior, trust/security impact, files changed, negative and positive tests, version or canonical-hash impact, and any gate not run. Changes affecting receipts, traces, scenarios, metrics, or reports must state how reproducibility was checked.

| Change type | Minimum evidence |
|---|---|
| Provenance, schema, or admission | Adversarial authority-claim tests and valid-admission tests. |
| Assembly or compaction | Exact-binding, region-placement, protected-residency, and unsatisfied-budget tests. |
| Interception or predicates | Observe/warn/enforce tests and proof that enforce blocks before simulator mutation. |
| Receipt, trace, or replay | Structural tamper and logical-divergence tests. |
| Scenario, adapter, metric, or report | Focused benchmark tests and a fresh smoke run. |

## Security reports

Do not disclose vulnerabilities in a public issue. Follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Claims and documentation

Describe simulator outputs as **deterministic conformance/regression evidence**, never real-model efficacy. Context-delivery receipts show what the runtime delivered and decided; they do not prove model understanding or compliance.
